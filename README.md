# maxima-packages

maxima-packages is a collection of packages for the Maxima computer algebra system
which have been contributed by users.

These packages have not been reviewed carefully,
neither for correctness nor for security problems.
Users accept all risk for using these packages.

All packages in maxima-packages can be modified by others,
via the same mechanism (a pull request) by which the package was originally created.
Project administrators will give the original package author an opportunity
to review pull requests for their packages,
but if the original author does not take action to accept or reject the pull request,
project administrators will take action, at their discretion.

At this time (February 2018), there is not yet an automatic mechanism
to download and install these packages, but such a mechanism is under development.
